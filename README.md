# Horizon
*Explore what's above â€” from satellites to aircraft*.

## Description
Horizon is a two-phase aviation and aerospace tracking tool that monitors real-time overhead activity using publicly available aerospace and weather data.
The project starts as a Rust based commmand-line interface (CLI) focused on performance, data processing, and efficient API interaction. It will 
evolve into a grapical user interface (GUI) written in C#, offering an intuitive visual dashboard for users to track sky activity in their region.

Horizon shhowcases clean archictecural practices, real-time API intergration, and robust CI/CD automation. It's designed to demonstrate skills in systems
programming, UI development, cross-language project structuring, and live data aggregation in the fields of aerospace and meteorology.
